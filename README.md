# HiLighter
I'm sick of the crappy highlighting apps on the Chrome appstore. I want to build an app where I can just paste a URL and it will save the file and I can highlight it to my hearts content. Maybe I can create a parser to extract text and make it more readable, but we'll get to that later.
